//The logic of this code is to emulate a game of tic-tac-toe. It will be a game
//of three rounds. Best of three out of 5 rounds wins
//Code plan - a function to receive and return the choice of the player.
        //  - a function to receive and return the choice of ai mode
        //  - a game controller function to switch between player choice and ai choice and return game state
        //  - a function to keep track of score based on game state and display results
        //  - a function to implement the type of AI based on player choice (minimax algorithm)
//Now each line may have more functions
